# Project: Iterative Imputer

  -> This project demonstrates Iterative Imputation, an advanced technique where each feature with missing values is modeled as a function of other features in a round-robin regression          approach.
  -> It helps maintain relationships between variables and often provides more accurate imputations than simple statistical methods.

## Highlights:-

 -> Implementation of IterativeImputer from sklearn.experimental
 -> Comparison with traditional imputers (Mean, Median, KNN)
 -> Works for both numerical and mixed data types
 -> Shows how model-based imputation preserves feature correlations
 -> Visualization of imputed vs. original data distributions

## Libraries Used:-
-> pandas
-> numpy
-> sklearn
-> matplotlib
-> seaborn

## Goal:-
-> To explore model-based missing value imputation using regression-based iteration, improving accuracy and data consistency over traditional methods.
